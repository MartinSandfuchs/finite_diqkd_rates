# Compute finite round key rates using fixed-point method

This repository contains a sample implementation of the fixed-point method described in my master's thesis. The implementation consists of two files, both written in julia. The first file `npa.jl` contains an implementation of the NPA hierarchy. The second file `finite_rates.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the actual fixed-point method.
